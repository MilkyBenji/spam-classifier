## **Project Overview**  

### **Introduction**  
This project implements a **Na√Øve Bayes-based spam detection model** with an **interactive web interface** using **Gradio**. The classifier predicts whether an input message is **Spam** or **Not Spam** based on textual features.

## **Motivation and Purpose**  
Spam messages are a persistent issue in digital communication, affecting **email services, SMS platforms, and chat applications**. This project aims to:  

- Build an interactive **spam classification system**.  
- Explore the effectiveness of **Na√Øve Bayes** for text classification.  
- Provide an easy-to-use **Gradio interface** for real-time spam detection.

## **Problem Statement and Objectives**  

### **Problem Statement:**  
Identifying spam messages manually is inefficient and time-consuming. The objective of this project is to develop an **automated spam classifier** that can **accurately detect spam messages** using machine learning.

### **Objectives:**  
‚úîÔ∏è Train a **Na√Øve Bayes classifier** to classify text as **Spam** or **Not Spam**.  
‚úîÔ∏è Use **TF-IDF vectorization** to extract key features from text.  
‚úîÔ∏è Deploy the model using **Gradio** for real-time user interaction.  
‚úîÔ∏è Ensure high accuracy and robustness of the classifier.

## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset consists of labeled messages used to train the spam classifier:

| Feature | Description |  
|---------|------------|  
| **Message** | The text content of the message |  
| **Label** | Spam (1) or Not Spam (0) |  

üìå **Data Preprocessing Steps:**  
- **Text Cleaning:** Removal of stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.  
- **Tokenization:** Breaking messages into individual words.  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converting text into numerical form for model training.  

---

## **Model Architecture**  
The **Na√Øve Bayes Classifier** is used for spam classification, following these steps:

1. **Text Preprocessing** ‚Äì Cleaning and transforming message text.  
2. **Feature Extraction** ‚Äì Converting text into numerical features.  
3. **Training the Model** ‚Äì Using **Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes** for classification.  
4. **Deploying with Gradio** ‚Äì Creating an interactive user interface.  

üìå **Hyperparameters Used:**  
- **Model**: Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes  
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF Vectorization  
- **Stopwords Removal**: Applied for better classification

## **Installation and Usage**  

### **üîß Prerequisites**  
Install the necessary dependencies before running the project:  

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn gradio
```

### **üìå Running the Model**  

#### **Clone the Repository:**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MilkyBenji/SpamClassifier.git
cd SpamClassifier
```

#### **Run the Application:**  
```bash
python app.py
```

This will launch the **Gradio interface**, allowing users to enter messages and receive predictions.

## **Evaluation and Results**  

### **üìä Model Performance**  
The **Na√Øve Bayes model** was evaluated using classification metrics:

- **Accuracy:** Measures overall correctness.  
- **Precision & Recall:** Determines effectiveness in detecting spam.  
- **Confusion Matrix:** Provides insight into classification performance.

üìå **Visualization:**  
- A **classification report** details precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- **Sample predictions** demonstrate the model's accuracy on unseen text.  

### **üìà Sample Prediction**  

Given a sample input:
```python
sample_message = "Congratulations! You have won a free iPhone. Click here to claim."
```

The model predicts:
```bash
Predicted Label: Spam
```
